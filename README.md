  ## Description 
  This application is my personal portfolio which was built using React. A list of the projects I have worked on, my latest resume, and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn can all be found in this React application. The navigation bar at the top page allows the user to navigate to the various pages. The links at the bottom of the page will direct the user to my personal GitHub and LinkedIn pages. Under the resume tab, a link is provided that will allow the user to download my resume.
